#  How to Contribute to concrete5 Core Code

Community contributions are one of the key points that make open source software so great.
And concrete5 is no exception, so we'd like to thank you for your help.

## What We'd Love Help On

We've tried to categorize our issues in ways that will make it clear how best we can use your help. In general, if something is labelled as "Available" it is ready for development! If you find an issue that is labeled in this way, without a dedicated person assigned to it, post that you'd like to work on it, and go for it. When you're done submit a pull request and we'll review it right away for inclusion.

## Pull Requests

Before submitting pull requests, please be sure to read our extensive guidelines about submitting code to concrete5:

https://documentation.concrete5.org/tutorials/submitting-code-to-concrete5

Need to fix the coding style of your PHP files prior to submissions? Are you working on concrete5 version 9? To fix the coding style of the files you created/modified, simply call:  
  `./concrete/bin/concrete5 c5:phpcs fix <path>`  
  (On Windows, replace `/` with `\`).  
  Where `<path>` is the file you modified (you can also specify multiple files, as well as using directories).

- Pull requests that address existing issues are much **much** more likely to be accepted than unsolicited pull requests. 

Thanks everyone!
